            <p>Below, is a mixture of applications I've built during my time at Prime Digital Academy, as well as
               personal side projects I created. Please feel free to take a look at them. A quick note, for the applications
               deployed to Heroku, please allow for 10-15 seconds to load.

                    <p>
                        HEROKU-DEPLOYED: A simple application for users to utilize to list out their tasks. My goal is to renovate
                        this entire application's UI.

                        GITHUB REPO currently being renovated: CRUD application for users to store their movie into their own personal collection. I 
                        created this from my time at Prime Digital Academy. It is an application for users to manage the movies they enjoy. It was my first
                        project that introduced me to redux sagas.

                        GITHUB REPO currently in the works: A personal project of mine, to combat depression. Users can store what makes them
                       happy inside this app. My goal is to share this with my young nieces and nephews to introduce them to software development
                       and to show them what their aunt does.
