            <p>Below, is a mixture of applications I've built during my time at Prime Digital Academy, as well as
               personal side projects. A quick note, for the applications deployed to Heroku, please allow for 10-15 seconds to load. 
               Additionally I'd like to add, I am currently trying to renovate most applications using semantic html, css, and exploring
               Material-UI and React Semantic-UI so please excuse ongoing coding. If not ready to deploy, you'll be taken to the Readme of 
               the repo and can view the screenshots for your convenience.

                        HEROKU-DEPLOYED: A simple application for users to utilize to list out their tasks. My goal is to renovate
                        this entire application's UI.

                        An application meant for giving feedback to an organization, particularly in this application I imagined
                        Prime Digital Academy students would appreciate a feedback application. It is crucial for any program 
                        to allow for feedback to improve curriculum. <br>|| React & Express & Node.js & Redux

                        An application for users to store their movie into their own personal collection. I 
                        created this during my time at Prime Digital Academy. It is an application for users to manage the movies they enjoy. 
                        I am currently renovating it to be fully CRUD. <br>|| React & Express & Node.js & Redux

                        My capstone project at Prime Digital Academy. It is a CRUD application targeting to ease the writing community's pain of
                        writer's block. The psychology behind this app is simple, pulling creative inspiration from our dreams for content creation.
                        The current stretch goal I'm adding is capturing react canvas and saving that into a database. <br>|| React & Express & Node.js & Redux

                       and to show them what their aunt does. <br> || React & Express & Node.js & Redux
