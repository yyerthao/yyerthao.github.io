      I am a Full Stack Software Developer, currently studying at <i>Prime Digital Academy.</i> It feels absolutely
      rewarding to build sites, create servers, and connect both front and back end. There's just something about seeing code come to
      life that I thoroughly enjoy.
    </p>
    <p class="p p2">Outside of speaking, writing, and reading code, I love cooking up something, anything, and everything in the kitchen. 
      It is also fair to say I enjoy spending time with my toddlers and seeing them achieve their little big milestones. Kids are blank canvasses and
      we must do our part to shape them to be good, kind humans.
