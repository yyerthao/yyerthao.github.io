                If you'd like to connect, please find the following ways to connect below. I would love to have
                a conversation with fellow working parents, women & men in tech, women & men NOT in tech,
                pho lovers, coffee enthusiasts to really anyone who'd love to connect.

                I am a huge avid believer of always connecting. I grew up within a tight knit community. It wasn't until
                I went to college at age 18, I recognized there is so much more to learn, so many more individuals to
                meet
                and be inspired by. Let me hear your story of how you came to this space, or even simply my portfolio.

                LinkedIn is a wonderful platform in connecting. I invite you to connect with me there
                as I aim to share my software development journey there with my network. I've found this
                platform particularly important as many folks share not just professional insight but
                valuable human posts that encourage and uplift. I also enjoy finding the humanizing 
                aspect of each post and aim to relay the message, we are all humans first.

                Take a look at my GitHub repositories and code. For your convenience, with most of the 
                repositories on my profile, I've included screenshots & technologies in each repository's 
                readme. From no code prior to September 2020 to now, I feel blissful being in this challenging 
                but never dull space.

                Connect with me through Email. As someone who wishes to be transparent in all she does, 
                even if I am not the right candidate yet, I would love to connect now and learn from you. 
                I am a firm believer we can all learn a few things from anyone. With that, I aim to always 
                stay humble and be inspired by each individual I come across. I would also be happy to provide
                my resume upon request.
