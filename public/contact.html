                If you'd like to connect, please find the following ways to connect below. I would love to have
                a conversation with fellow working parents, women & men in tech, women & men NOT in tech,
                pho lovers, coffee enthusiasts to really anyone who'd love to connect.

                I am a huge avid believer of always connecting. I grew up within a tight knit community. It wasn't until
                I went to college at age 18, I recognized there is so much more to learn, so many more individuals to
                meet
                and be inspired by. Let me hear your story of how you came to this space, or even simply my portfolio.

                LinkedIn has been the platform I turn to to share my journey and current projects. 
                I also enjoy this platform for the inspirational folks I've met as well.

                Feel free to take a look at my GitHub repositories and code. Most of my repos should just
                about have screenshots of the application UI.

                Click to send me an email right away. As a transparent person, even if I can't 
                be the candidate for you now, I'd love for you to keep me in mind for future roles and let's start
                that connection now anyways.
