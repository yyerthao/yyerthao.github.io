                    In 2015, I graduated from Minnesota State University, Mankato, MN with a Bachelors of Arts in
                    English Literature. I had plans to pursue higher education in order to teach
                    creative arts in prose and poetry. 
                    
                    However, today, I am a Full Stack Software Developer. 
                    It is definitely a huge career change from origin choice of profession, but I recognize the
                    different, dynamic work environment coding provides me great pleasure. This field is ever-so evolving so 
                    on the up side, there will never be a dull work day.

                    Outside of code, I love spending time with my wonderful boys. This summer, we enjoyed creating
                    obstacle courses in our backyard, going on hikes, and renovating our home together. Being a mom is 
                    one of the greatest gifts I've had the privilege to receive.

                    Another one of my greatest passions is having writer's block (5 years and counting++).
