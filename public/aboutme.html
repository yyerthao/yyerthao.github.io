                        In 2015, I graduated from Minnesota State University, Mankato, MN with a Bachelors of Arts in
                        English Literature, with an emphasis on Creative Writing. My professional scope at the time was bringing 
                        awareness to the experiences
                        of marginalized folks. I dedicated my time researching and finding local voices to highlight,
                        however I decided to pursue this another way, entering the tech space to help close the gender BIPOC gap. 
                        I grew up never thinking twice about the tech industry because well, I never saw women who looked like me let alone women.

                        "Yog yus xav ua ib lub neej zoo, yus yuav tsum khws. Yog yus xav ua lub neej phem, ib ntsais muag xwb yeej ua tau." 
                        This is a saying my dad always guided me with and still goes. It translates to, "If you want a good life, you have to work hard. If you
                        want a bad life, in the blink of an eye you can." It takes time, hard work, dedication and perserverance to have that good life.
                    </p>
                        Forward a few years after, I embarked on that good life journey. I enrolled and graduated from Prime Digital Academy, an immersive
                        full time five month program. Here I learned the PERN (Postgresl, Express, React, Node), how to collaborate
                        with other developers, as well as other aspects of being a developer (learning to communicate, learning about bias and
                        so much more).
                        If interested, please check out <a href="https://www.primeacademy.io/">Prime Digital Academy</a>. I will 100%
                        always recommend them as they've changed my life for the best.

                        Right out of college, I got married and started a family. Through the past few years, I recognized
                        how important it is to give back. I asked myself, "How can I ensure my children's lives
                        will be okay?" Through time, I realized it's not about providing them a life of rich goods but being part of
                        the change that needs to happen for THEIR environment. With this in mind, I found myself exploring 
                        new roles to give back. I held a variety of roles from tutoring English, 
                        mentoring college students, being a school-aged teacher, to pharmacy technician.

                        I'm also more than just the label I've given myself from my landing page. I'm also a 
                        proud, proud mom, wife, sister, daughter, friend, mentor, garden enthusiast, and aching traveler. 
                        Additionally, I enjoy cooking spicy foods, trying to perfect my home made
                        pho broth, watching Mukbang, meditation and yoga.
