                        In 2015, I graduated from Minnesota State University, Mankato, MN with a Bachelors of Arts in
                        English Literature, emphasis on Creative Writing. My professional scope at the time was bringing 
                        awareness to the experiences
                        of marginalized folks. I dedicated my time researching and finding local voices to highlight,
                        however I decided to pursue this another way; one of my goals is to create a workshop for 
                        young POC girls to get into coding.

                        Right out of college, I took a hiatus and started my precious little family. We reside
                        in the Greater Twin Cities of Minnesota and absolutely love the four seasons here. 
                        After becoming a mom, I've become more bold and daring to challenge myself
                        to do greater things. So, here I am. Not in a million years would I have thought
                        I'd get into the tech field, but I'm here and loving it.
                    </p>

                        Some hobbies of mine include: cooking lots of spicy foods, trying to perfect my home made
                        pho broth, watching Mukbang, meditation, yoga, and 'thinking' about writing (currently have 
                        5 years of ongoing writer's block and counting++). Oh and I also love making bad code puns, and 
                        bad dad jokes that no one laughs at.
