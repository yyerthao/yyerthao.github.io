            Hello! I reside in the Greater Twin Cities of absolutely, beautiful Minnesota.
            I love experiencing all seasons here, spending quality time with my two boys, and contemplating
            about when to have that next cup of coffee.

            Aside from being a mom and a poet with writer's block (5 years and counting++),
            I am ecstatic to say I am a Full Stack Software Engineer.
