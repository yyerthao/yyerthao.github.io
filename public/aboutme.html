                    Aside from being a Full Stack Software Developer, I enjoy writing poems. I currently
                    have ongoing writer's block (5 years and counting++).
                    I graduated from Minnesota State University, in Mankato, MN, in 2015 with a Bachelors of Arts in
                    English Literature. Fast-forward to
                    present day, I am a Full Stack Software Developer. It is definitely a huge career change from origin
                    choice of profession.
                    However, I am loving the different, dynamic work environment coding provides me. This field is ever-so
                    evolving so I know I won't ever have a dull day.

                    Some personal interests of mine include: binge watching Korean dramas, watching YouTube cook videos and
                    attempting to recreate them, watching Korean eating shows(Mukbang and ASMR).
