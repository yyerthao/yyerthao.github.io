                Aside from being a Full Stack Software Developer, I am also a poet with ongoing writer's block (5 years
                and counting++).
                I graduated from Minnesota State University, in Mankato, MN, in 2015 with a Bachelors of Arts in
                English. Fast-forward to
                present day, I am a Full Stack Software Developer. It is definitely a huge career change from origin
                choice of profession.
                However, I am loving the different, dynamic work environment coding provides me. This field is ever-so
                evolving so I know I won't ever have a dull day.

                Some personal interests of mine include: binge watching Korean dramas, watching YouTube cook videos and
                attempting
                to recreate the recipes, watching Korean eating shows(Mukbang and ASMR - highly recommend checking
                out.).
