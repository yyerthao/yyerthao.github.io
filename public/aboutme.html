            Hello! I reside in the Greater Twin Cities of absolutely, beautiful Minnesota.
            I love experiencing all seasons here, spending quality time with my two boys, and contemplating
            about when to have that next cup of coffee.
        </p> -->
        <!-- <p class=" p p2">Essentially, anything coffee, food-related, I am game for.</p> -->
        <p class="p p2">
            Aside from being a Full Stack Software Developer, I am a proud boy mom and a poet with writer's block (5 years and counting++).
            I attended college in 2011, at the Minnesota State University, in Mankato, MN. I obtained my Bachelor of Arts in English Literature
            and dreamed of pursuing higher education to one day teach creative writing. Upon taking a hiatus after graduating in 2015, 
            I decided to spend more time with my little family.
