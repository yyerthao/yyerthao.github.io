                    In 2015, I graduated from Minnesota State University, Mankato, MN with a Bachelors of Arts in
                    English Literature, emphasis on Creative Writing. My professional scope at the time was bringing 
                    awareness to the experiences
                    of marginalized folks. I dedicated my time researching and finding local voices to highlight,
                    however I decided to pursue this another way; one of my goals is to create a workshop for 
                    young POC girls to get into coding.

                    Right out of college, I took a hiatus and started my precious little family. We reside
                    in the Greater Twin Cities of Minnesota and absolutely love the four seasons here. 
                    After becoming a mom, I've become more bold and daring to challenge myself
                    to do greater things. So, here I am. Not in a million years would I have thought
                    I'd get into the tech field, but I'm here and loving it.

                    Some hobbies of mine include: cooking lots of spicy foods, trying to perfect my home made
                    pho broth, watching Mukbang, meditation, yoga, and 'thinking' about writing (currently have 
                    5 years of ongoing writer's block and counting++). Oh and I also love making bad code puns, and 
                    bad dad jokes that no one laughs at.
