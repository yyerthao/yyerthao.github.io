        <!-- <p class="p">
            Hello! I reside in the Greater Twin Cities of absolutely, beautiful Minnesota.
            I love experiencing all seasons here, spending quality time with my two boys, and contemplating
            about when to have that next cup of coffee.
        </p> -->
        <!-- <p class=" p p2">Essentially, anything coffee, food-related, I am game for.</p> -->
        <p class="p p2">
            Aside from being a Full Stack Software Developer, I am also a poet with fun writer's block (5 years and counting++).
            I attended college in 2011, at Minnesota State University, in Mankato, MN. I obtained my Bachelor of Arts in English Literature
            and dreamt of pursuing higher education. When I graduated in 2015, I decided to spend more time with my 
            little family.
        </p>
        <p class="p p2">
            Fast-forward to present day, I am a Full Stack Software Developer. It is definitely a huge career change from origin choice of profession, 
            Creative Writer professor. However, I am loving the different, dynamic work environment coding provides. This field is ever-so evolving
            so I know I won't ever have a dull day.
