                        In 2015, I graduated from Minnesota State University, Mankato, MN with a Bachelors of Arts in
                        English Literature, with an emphasis on Creative Writing. My professional scope at the time was bringing 
                        awareness to the experiences
                        of marginalized folks. I dedicated my time researching and finding local voices to highlight,
                        however I decided to pursue this another way which is why this static portfolio site exists.

                        Right out of college, I took a hiatus and started a family. Through the past few years, I recognized
                        how important it is to give back. I asked myself, "How can I ensure my children's lives
                        will be okay?" Through time, I realized it's not about providing them a life of rich goods but being part of
                        the change that needs to happen for THEIR environment. With this in mind, I found myself exploring 
                        new roles to find my place in giving back. I held a variety of roles from tutoring English, 
                        mentoring college students, being a school aged teacher, to pharmacy technician. I found myself
                        struggling to enjoy a daily life in the roles I took on. And now I'm here for the ongoing learning.
                        I think it's safe to say there is never a dull day in tech for me, everyday I'm learning something.

                        Now, I'm also more than just the label I've given myself from my landing page. I'm also a 
                        proud, proud mom, wife, sister, daughter, friend, mentor, garden enthusiast, and aching traveler. 
                        Additionally, I enjoy cooking spicy foods, trying to perfect my home made
                        pho broth, watching Mukbang, meditation and yoga.
