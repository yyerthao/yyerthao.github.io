                    I'm a sun loving Full Stack Software Engineer who's made the transition into
                    the tech in order to be in a space where I will always be challenged, and can always grow. 
                    Personally, I find it absolutely crucial for everyone to always learn something new each day; 
                    there's just too much too learn and we're all so capable to always make this effort.

                    I am not only that above, but a superhero mom of two boys, rookie garden enthusiast, and a
                    writer. Content-wise, my theme of my written works are dedicated around raising awareness
                    on marginalized folks. One of my goals this year is to publish a collection of my works.

                    This quote rings true and dear to my heart. I just can't say this enough to everyone I know and 
                    meet, there can never be too much kindness to give.
