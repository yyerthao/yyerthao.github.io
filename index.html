                    Initial: I'm a sun loving Full Stack Software Engineer who's made the transition into
                    the tech industry in order to be in a space where I will always be challenged, and can always grow.
                    Personally, I find it absolutely crucial for everyone to always learn something new each day; 
                    there's just too much to learn. We're all immensely capable to make this effort to become
                    better versions of ourselves.

                    Bio: I'm a mom, of two boys. Some days I'm exhausted, but most days I'm building diy 
                    obstacle courses for them to parkour around the house. Some days we get messy with paint, kinetic
                    sand, play dough. Being a mom, has taught me to be resilient in the face of unbearable anxiety.
                    Most of all, being a mom has given me the drive I need to do great things; my goal is to impact the
                    world a little in hopes of making the world less scary for my kids to grow up in.

                    Personality: I'm a bit qwerky (I'm not sure what that means though)... I enjoy
                    the freedom to be myself while I work hard toward my goals in work and my personal life.
                    Wherever I am at, I aim to ensure those around me feel safe, included, and respected, all while
                    keeping the atmosphere uplifting, empowered, and full of smiles.

                    Mental: I believe in the power of empathy, kindness, and generosity. This year should have taught us
                    more than anything, how much more we need these virtues. My strength as a team player, is ensuring my teammates
                    feel empowered, reaffirmed in the fact they are humans first before anything in the role they

                    This quote rings true and dear to my heart. I just can't say this enough to everyone I know and 
                    meet, there can never be too much kindness to give.
